          When I was in highschool, I had honest trouble in math. My teachers
          favored the students who took outside classes, did AMCs, and it was
          hard to keep up in the double accelerated classes. However, the math
          classes became too easy when I dropped from that program. It was up
          until senior year, AP Calculus AB that I had the most fun and worst
          experience of my life. My teacher, Mrs. Chung, was known to be an
          absolute menace. I consistently failed her exams starting with a 53%
          on the first test, then a 54%, 63%, 64%, until I finally passed the
          fifth test with a 71%. She taught us so well that she says she has
          never had a student get lower than a 5 on the AB exam.

          To save my own time, I took the BC exam after taking the AB class. I
          did not study for any material in the BC exam and walked in only
          knowing what Mrs. Chung taught about AB. Unsurprisingly enough, I got
          a 5 on the AB portion, but also the BC portion. That entire class was
          what made my love for mathematics bloom.
